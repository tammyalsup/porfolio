        Intermountain Healing Hearts (IHH) is a 501c(3) non-profit organization for families of children and adults with
        congenital heart defects (CHD) and childhood onset heart disease. Most of our members live in the Intermountain
        West (Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Montana and Wyoming) and are seen primarily at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt
        Lake City, Utah. Intermountain Healing Hearts offers resources and a caring support network as families find
        answers and move forward to find healing and hope.
        <br><br>
        IHH has a very active Facebook Group where you can ask questions, talk with other parents, and find a safe place
        to express your feelings. It is a "closed" group so only registered members who are direct caregivers of
        children with a CHD or adults with CHD's can see your posts. If you would like to join the conversation, please
        register to become a member of IHH then click the "Join" button on our Facebook Group. Those who are not direct
        caregivers but who would still like to support IHH, please watch our website or "like" our public Facebook page
        for updates and information about the CHD community.
        <br><br>
        And if you aren't on Facebook, we still want to hear from you. Complete the registration form and/or send an
        email to info@ihhearts.org and someone will reach out to you.
        <br><br>
        Intermountain Healing Hearts has three online Support Groups to meet our members' needs. First complete the
        membership form, then request to join the group(s) that you fit into.:
